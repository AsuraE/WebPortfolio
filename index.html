                <strong>Course Reflection</strong>
                <p>Looking at the journal post I wrote for the first week on my expectations for the course, I can confidently say that the majority of them were not met. Instead of having a chance to work on developing front end web skills, the majority of my work was on the backend. This was a necessity amongst our group, as the other members had problems understanding the basic concepts of programming, such as control flow and loops (which should be evident from large sections of our completed website). Thus, instead of learning anything new I spent the semester completing boring, basic functionality for the website, half of which was never used. The one expectation I did have that was met however, was having group members who were not pulling their weight. In the end, it was easier for me to just finish the work myself rather than spend twice as long acting as a teacher to them, which is where this course severely fell short. </p>
                <p>In our group, we had a grand total of three hours a week when we could meet up, and those three hours were the contact sessions and the lecture. Apart from one contact session where we actually got to work on the project, the contacts were 20 to 30 minute long exercises dragged out to last two hours, which very rarely had any relevance to helping complete the project. This lead to us regularly ditching the lecture sessions just to have a chance to actually work together as a group, which in turn lead to the situation I described above where it was just quicker and easier to complete the work myself than to have to teach others. There was simply no time to come together as a group and properly work on the project, which is the one of the reasons why I view this course as the single worse course I've taken at university. Another reason for this view is the fact that I didn't learn anything at all during this course.</p>
                <p>I honestly cannot think of a thing that I have learnt from this course. Maybe if I stretched the definition of learning to include becoming more familar with JavaScript syntax then I could say that I learnt something. The activities were largely pointless, elongated wastes of time. Comparing the activities we were forced to complete for this course to the activities from DECO1100, there is a vast difference in usefulness. In DECO1100, the results of activities actively built upon the project, refining it at each step. In this course, there was little to no usefulness. Activities would either point out things that we could already see, or would be so bewildering out of place or factually incorrect (the "venn diagram" exercise being a prime example of this), that the results were useless. This is all on top of the fact that all the feedback we were getting was coming from people not in our target audience. We literally weren't able to get relevant feedback whatsoever, but had to use this feedback to "improve" our project.</p>
                <p>All in all, the one change I would make to improve my experience in the course would be to view the entire thing as a solo project. Doing so would lead to better time management, better code quality, a more cohesive design, and possibly a chance to actually learn something to do with front-end design and styling, simply because I wouldn't have to be sitting in useless contact sessions just because I'm part of a group. As for changes to the course itself to improve it, there's two main things that I would suggest. First, actually give groups time to come together and work on the project during class. Every other team project does this, and it works well. It gives groups an actual set time when they have to come together and work. Second, concentrate the contact exercises down into only what is necessary, link those exercises directly to the project, and make sure the exercises themselves actually make sense and aren't just busywork.</p>

                <strong>About Me</strong>
                <p>Hi, my name's Connor Cooper and I'm studying a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Software Information Systems and Software Design, at the University of Queensland. I'm more of a programmer than a designer, which is reflected in the side projects I work on when I'm not completing university assignments. These usually involve developing emulators, messing around with operating systems for micro computers like the raspberry pi, and designing gaming hardware. I'm set to graduate at the end of this semester. </p>
                <p>Technology-wise, I'm proficient in C, C++, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP. During my time at university I have studided Operating Systems Architecture, Compilers and Interpreters, Computer Networks, Advanced Computer and Network Security, and Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>
                <p>I can be contacted any time via email at connor.cooper@uqconnect.edu.au.</p>
